# üîç SVM Optimization on UCI Room Occupancy Estimation Dataset

## üìå Objective

This project focuses on optimizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on a multi-class dataset from the UCI repository. The goal is to evaluate the model's performance across 10 randomized samples and identify the best SVM hyperparameters through iterative optimization.

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Dataset was loaded using `ucimlrepo`.
   - Missing values checked and cleaned (if any).
   - Target column extracted, converted to a flat series for modeling.

2. **Data Splitting**
   - Dataset was randomly split into 10 **70-30 train-test samples** to test SVM consistency.
   - Stratification was used to preserve class balance.

3. **SVM Optimization**
   - SVM was tuned for each sample using Grid Search or a metaheuristic approach (e.g., Genetic Algorithm/Random Search).
   - Key hyperparameters tuned:
     - `kernel` (linear, rbf, poly, sigmoid)
     - `C` (penalty parameter)
     - `gamma` (kernel coefficient)
   - Each sample went through **100 iterations**, logging the best accuracy in each round.

4. **Result Compilation**
   - The best accuracy and hyperparameters for each sample were stored in a table.

5. **Visualization**
   - A **convergence graph** was plotted for the sample that achieved the **maximum accuracy**, showing accuracy vs iterations.

## üìå Conclusion

- SVM performed best with the **RBF kernel** and moderate-to-high `C` values.
- The optimization process revealed consistent performance across samples with minor variance.
- The convergence graph confirms that optimal hyperparameters were reached early and remained stable, validating the robustness of the optimization approach.
